# Rpi-ws2812-server
This is a small program for driving the WS281x (a.k.a. [NeoPixel](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12999)) LEDs from a webserver, command line, text file, Python,... using the Raspberry Pi. It uses the rpi_ws281x PWM driver code from jgarff ([https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)). The LEDs can be controlled by sending text commands to a tcp socket. These commands can be generated by a webserver script, android app,... It's also possible to control the leds directly from the command line or by loading text file containing some predefined color patterns.

# Installation
On the raspberry you open a terminal window and type following commands:
* `sudo apt-get update`
* `sudo apt-get install gcc make git libjpeg-dev libpng-dev`
* `git clone https://github.com/smartfuturecode/rpi-ws2812-server.git`
* `cd rpi-ws2812-server`
* `make`
* `sudo chmod +x ws2812svr`

Newer versions require libjpeg-dev and libpng-dev for reading PNG and JPEG images.
If you don't want to use JPEG or PNG you can disable this using:
* `make NO_JPEG=1 NO_PNG=1`

On newer Raspbian (Jessie) operating system the audio output is activated by default, you need to disable this:
You can do this by blacklisting the sound module:
`sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/snd-blacklist.conf`
```
blacklist snd_bcm2835
```

also in `/boot/config.txt` you comment out the `audio=on` parameter:
```
# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
#dtparam=audio=on
```

# Testing
Connect your LEDs to the PWM output of the Raspberry Pi and start the program:

* `sudo ./ws2812svr`

Now first initialize the driver code from jgarff by typing 'setup'.
On the following line you must **replace 10** by the number of leds you have attached!.

* `setup 1,10`
* `init`

Now you can type commands to change the color of the leds.
For example make them all red:

* `fill 1,FF0000`
* `render`

# Supported commands
Here is a list of commands you can type or send to the program. All commands have optional comma seperated parameters. The parameters must be in the correct order!

* `setup` command must be called everytime the program is started:
```

# Special keywords
You can add `do ... loop` to repeat commands when using a file or TCP connection.

For example the commands between `do` and `loop` will be executed 10 times:
```
do   
   <enter commands here to repeat>    
loop 10
```
(Endless loops can be made by removing the '10')

For `do ... loop` to work from a TCP connection we must start a new thread. 
This thread will continue to execute the commands when the client disconnects from the TCP/IP connection. 
The thread will automatically stop executing the next time the client reconnects (ideal for webservers).

For example:
```
thread_start   
   do  
      rotate 1,1,2  
     render  
     delay 200  
  loop  
thread_stop  
<client must close connection now>   
```

# PHP example
First start the server program:

* `sudo ./ws2812svr -tcp`

Then run the php code from the webserver:

```PHP
//create a rainbow for 10 leds on channel 1:  
send_to_leds("setup channel_1_count=10;rainbow;brightness 1,32;");  
function send_to_leds ($data){  
   $sock = fsockopen("127.0.0.1", 9999);  
   fwrite($sock, $data);  
   fclose($sock);  
}
```

# Command line parameters
* `sudo ./ws2812svr -tcp 9999`
  Listens for clients to connect to port 9999 (default).
* `sudo ./ws2812svr -f text_file.txt`
  Loads commands from text_file.txt.
* `sudo ./ws2812svr -p /dev/ws281x`
  Creates a file called `/dev/ws281x` where you can write you commands to with any other programming language (do-loop not supported here).
* `sudo ./ws2812svr -i "setup 1,4,5;init;"`
  Initializes with command setup 1,4,5  and command init
